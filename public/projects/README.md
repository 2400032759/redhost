Place your project screenshots here so they load automatically on the Our Projects page.

Naming convention:
- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated slugs for filenames.
- Example: the screenshot you provided for Big Classes should be named `bigclasses.png`.

So, copy your file `Screenshot 2025-10-29 213052.png` into this folder and rename it to:

  bigclasses.png

After that, rebuild (`npm run build`) or restart your dev server (`npm run dev`) and visit /projects â€” the page will show the provided screenshot for Big Classes.

Notes:
- Accepted formats: .png, .jpg, .webp (we recommend PNG or WEBP)
- Files placed in `public/projects/` are served as static assets at `https://your-site.com/projects/{filename}`
- If a screenshot is missing, the page will fall back to a bundled SVG thumbnail and then a live screenshot service.
